# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (2026-10-28)

- `checkout.released` and status `released`: a part payment SpotEx passed to your wallet without you accepting it (after it waited too long, or by support). The order is not paid; never fulfil on it. Checkouts carry `accepted_by`.
- `plans.create` and `plans.list`; `subscriptions.list`, `retrieve` and `cancel`: recurring payments from SpotEx balances.
- Checkouts carry `subscription_id` and `subscription_period`.
- USDT and other tokens on EVM chains: `checkouts.create` takes `network`, checkouts carry it, and each coin lists its `networks`.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-28)

- Prices in your own currency: `price` with `currency` (EUR, GBP, JPY and others) when creating checkout sessions and checkouts. `amount_usd` still works for dollars.
- Checkouts carry `price`, `currency` and `currency_rate_usd`; checkout sessions carry `price` and `currency`, with `amount_usd` null for a price not in dollars.
- `invoices.create`, `retrieve`, `list` and `void`: invoices with lines, a due date and a page of their own. Checkouts carry `invoice_id`.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-28)

- Webhook verification refuses an empty or missing signing secret instead of checking against an empty key, which anyone can sign with. This happens when `SPOTEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set but empty.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-27)

- First release: checkout sessions, checkouts (with test-mode simulate), coins, balance, payouts, and webhook verification.
